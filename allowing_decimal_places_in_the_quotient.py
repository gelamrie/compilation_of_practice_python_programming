#Ask user to enter two numbers that will be stored in num_1 and num_2
num_1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num_2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

#Check if num_2 is not equal to zero
#If true, solve for the quotient and display the result with decimal places
#If num_2 is equal to zero, diplay "Division by zero is not allowed"
